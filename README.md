# About This Project

Generated a multi-paged interactive Power-BI Dashboard focusing on the Netflixâ€™s extensive library of movies &amp; TV shows. Which Provides the analysis on total Movies,shows,Directors,Genres,Start&amp;End Year of the Movies &amp; TV Shows Release with Filters as Movie,Shows,Genres And also analyzed the trends of TV Shows,Movies globally


## Project Overview & Scope

Netflix is a popular streaming service that offers a vast catalog of movies, TV shows, and original contents. The data consist of contents added to Netflix from 1931 to 2021. The oldest content is as old as 1925 and the newest as 2021. In this project, I have cleaned the dataset using Jupyter Notebook and then visualized with PowerBI. The purpose of this project is to figure out possible ways for cleaning text data and dealing with timeseries values in Jupyter Notebook, along with visualization of cleaned data using PowerBI for spotting any trends or pattern in the data

## Data Cleaning

The raw dataset can be found here. This tabular dataset consists of listings of all the movies and tv shows available on Netflix, along with details such as - cast, directors, ratings, release year, duration, etc.

I have cleaned this dataset using JupyterNotebook , and the code can be found here. The final cleaned dataset used for visualization can be found here.
