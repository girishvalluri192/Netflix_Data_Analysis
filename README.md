# About This Project

Generated a multi-paged interactive Power-BI Dashboard focusing on the Netflixâ€™s extensive library of movies &amp; TV shows. Which Provides the analysis on total Movies,shows,Directors,Genres,Start&amp;End Year of the Movies &amp; TV Shows Release with Filters as Movie,Shows,Genres And also analyzed the trends of TV Shows,Movies globally


## Project Overview & Scope

Netflix is a popular streaming service that offers a vast catalog of movies, TV shows, and original contents. The data consist of contents added to Netflix from 1931 to 2021. The oldest content is as old as 1925 and the newest as 2021. In this project, I have cleaned the dataset using Jupyter Notebook and then visualized with PowerBI. The purpose of this project is to figure out possible ways for cleaning text data and dealing with timeseries values in Jupyter Notebook, along with visualization of cleaned data using PowerBI for spotting any trends or pattern in the data


### Insights Drawn from Home Page of DashBoard

for knowing the overall analytics of TV shows and Movies  based on filters like Genres , Release Year using Donut Chart , Bar Graph , World Map , Area Chart

The Count of Total Shows Released :  8800

The Count of Total Directors are :  4527

The Count of Total Genrea are : 37

The count of Locations where movies are released are :  750

The Start year of movie release : 1931

The End Year of Movie release  :  2021

The Area Chart shows that there are lot of releases of TV Shows & Movies between th year  2015 to 2021


Count of title By Type shows that total no.of TV Shows Released are only 30.39%  and Movies released are only 69.61%


Ratings from shows show that TV - MA has highest ratings 


Genre by shows Visual shows that Dramas , Comedies , Actions are most played compared to Horror , Thrillers

Created Buttons for navigation through pages Home , TV Shows , Movies , Refresh

## Data Cleaning

The raw dataset can be found here. This tabular dataset consists of listings of all the movies and tv shows available on Netflix, along with details such as - cast, directors, ratings, release year, duration, etc.

I have cleaned this dataset using JupyterNotebook , and the code can be found here. The final cleaned dataset used for visualization can be found here.



## Conclusion

5 main visual have been put together . I have presented only a handfull insights in this project There is always more one can find, as it has been rightly said
